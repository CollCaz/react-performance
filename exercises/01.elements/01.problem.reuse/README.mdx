# Reusing Elements

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/react-performance/reusing-elements" />

👨‍💼 We're going to be building a simple user interface and in the process we want
to limit unnecessary renders as much as possible (not because it's necessary
for this specific application, but because it's a useful exercise for you to
learn how to do for when it is necessary).

Right now, when you click the counter button, both the `App` and `Footer`
components rerender.

But the `Footer` component doesn't change so that render is unnecessary. So
please take advantage of React's element optimization by creating a `Footer`
element outside the `App` so you can render that inline in the `App` component.

Make sure to check the before/after using the React DevTools so you know that
your work is making a difference.
