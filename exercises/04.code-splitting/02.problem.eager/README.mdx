# Eager Loading

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/react-performance/eager-loading" />

👨‍💼 So it's great that the users can get the app loaded faster, but it's annoying
when 99% of the time the reason the users are using the app is so they can
interact with our globe. We don't want to have to make them wait first to load
the app and then again to load the globe. Wouldn't it be cool if we could have
globe start loading as soon as the user hovers over the checkbox? So if they
`pointerOver` or `focus` the `<label>` for the checkbox, we should kick off a
dynamic import for the globe module.

See if you can make that work.

	Tip: It doesn't matter how many times you call `import('./path-to-module')`,
	vite will only actually load the module once.
