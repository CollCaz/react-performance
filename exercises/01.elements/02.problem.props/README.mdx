# Element Props

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/react-performance/element-props" />

🧝‍♂️ I've enhanced our app a bit to add some buttons that will control the color
of our footer. This means we can't just render the component outside the `App`
component since we need to pass the `color` as a prop. Feel free
to <PrevDiffLink>check my work</PrevDiffLink>.

👨‍💼 Yep, to make it work, Kellie had to render the `<Footer />` in `<Main />`
which means the `<Footer />` gets rerendered every time we click the count
button even if the color doesn't change.

So your job is to restructure things so the `Footer` only re-renders when the
`color` is changed.

Make sure to pull up the React DevTools to be certain incrementing the count
doesn't trigger a rerender of the footer.
