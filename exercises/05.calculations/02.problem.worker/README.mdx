# Web Worker

<callout-warning>
	Warning, this one's _really_ cool, but kinda tricky... Also, the intent isn't
	necessarily for you to learn about [web
	workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers),
	but just to expose you to a good use case for them. You can get started
	learning about web workers in [Speed up your app with web
	workers](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/speed-up-your-app-with-web-workers).

👨‍💼 It's awesome that we reduced how often we have to call `searchCities`.
Unfortunately, on low-powered devices, `searchCities` is still quite slow when
it actually _does_ need to run and we'd like to speed it up. So I was thinking
that we need to ditch [`match-sorter`](https://npm.im/match-sorter) in favor of
a simple string `includes` because the experience is not fast enough (even
though `match-sorter` does provide a much superior UX).

But no! We must have the better UX! There may be ways to optimize `match-sorter`
itself, but let's try throwing this all into a web worker instead...

	This change is going to take two steps. So when we're finished with this bit,
	we actually won't see any improvement until we take advantage of it in the
	next step.

🧝‍♂️ To avoid distrupting our existing `App` component, I have
copied <InlineFile file="src/cities/index.ts" />
into <InlineFile file="src/cities/legacy.ts" /> and update the import
in <InlineFile file="src/app.tsx" />. Feel free
to <PrevDiffLink>check it out</PrevDiffLink>.

👨‍💼 Thanks Kellie! Now you're ready to make changes
in <InlineFile file="src/cities/index.ts" />
and <InlineFile file="src/cities/filter-cities.worker.ts" /> for this exercise.

Oh, and when you're finished with that, then go
into <InlineFile file="src/app.tsx" /> and add an import for `./cities/index.ts`
just so you can see the web worker get loaded into our sources tab of the
DevTools like this:

🦉 We'll be using a library called [`comlink`](https://npm.im/comlink) to manage
communication with this web worker and have some nice type safety. You may find
it useful to view the docs a bit for that project before proceeding.

We'll also be taking advantage of
[Vite's web workers feature](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#web-workers).
Those docs would also be useful to peruse just a bit.
