# Async Results

👨‍💼 Great job! Now if you take some measurements with the dev tools, you'll
notice that doing searches is much faster than before. Offloading this work is
a nice improvement!

## Why not `useDeferredValue`?

You may think this would be a case for `useDeferredValue` rather than
`useTransition`. However, `useTransition` is better for this situation because
the state we're changing is not the input value itself, but rather the matching
cities which are being fetched from the web worker. The transition will preserve
the existing UI (including the input we can still type in) while the new cities
are being fetched.
