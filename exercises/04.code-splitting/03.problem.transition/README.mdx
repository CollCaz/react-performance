# Transitions

👨‍💼 By default, when a component suspends (like our `lazy` component is while
we're lazy-loading some code), React will render the fallback of our suspense
boundary immediately. Go ahead and try it now. Hover over the checkbox for long
enough for the code to load and then check it. You'll notice even though the
code is ready to go, it still shows our fallback UI.

The reason this happens is React wants to help us avoid a flash of loading
state. So React will actually wait a little bit before switching from the
fallback to the real content. This is a good default, but it's definitely not
optimial.

So instead, we can wrap our state update `setShowGlobe` in a transition so React
doesn't go to the suspense fallback and instead we can show a pending UI if we
so decide.

This is similar to what we've done in the past, so if you'd like you can add
`useSpinDelay` from [`spin-delay`](https://npm.im/spin-delay) to prevent pushing
the flash of loading state to later if the globe's code isn't quite ready yet.
