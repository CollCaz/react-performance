# Windowing

👨‍💼 You did it! Great work on improving the performance of this component!

🦉 One thing you should know about virtualization is that ⌘+F (or on
Linux/Windows Ctrl+F) will not work out of the box. This is because the browser
doesn't know about the virtualized items. You can implement this yourself, but
it's a bit more complex (you've probably seen other apps do this). Hopefully
one day the platform will have a better primitive for this type of thing. The
web is always evolving!
