# Provider Component

👨‍💼 We've noticed that when we change some of the Footer context stuff, we're
actually rerendering the `App` and `Main` components even though those don't
have anything to do with the Footer context.

So we're going to take advantage of React's optimizations for reusing elements
by creating a `FooterProvider` component and accepting `children`. That way
whenever the Footer context changes, only the `FooterProvider` component and its
consumers will rerender. React will be able to reuse the `children` element
since that doesn't change when the Footer's state changes.

When you're finished, changing the footer color of setting the footer name
should not cause the `App` or `Main` components to rerender.
