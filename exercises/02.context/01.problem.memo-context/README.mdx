# Memoize Context

🧝‍♂️ I've taken the `name` and `color` state and combined them into a single
`FooterContext` as well as extracted some of the UI into a `FooterSetters`
component (for all the stuff that allows you to control the `Footer`). Feel free
to <PrevDiffLink>check my work</PrevDiffLink> to inspect the changes if you
want.

👨‍💼 Great, now if you pull up the React DevTools, you'll notice all the
components rerender whenever you change the counter in the App component. This
is happening because the `FooterContext.Provider` is a new `value` prop every
render.

So if you memoize the `value` prop with `useMemo`, you can prevent the
unnecessary rerender of consuming components when the `value` prop doesn't
change.
