👨‍💼 Great work! You've really explored React's element optimization a lot in this
exercise and hopefully it informs how you structure your components going
forward.

🦉 As a general reminder, you want to focus more of your efforts on making it
easier for humans to understand your code than on making it faster for the
computer to run unless you have a specific performance problem that you need to
address!
