# Concurrent Rendering

👨‍💼 React managed to provide this feature to developers by re-writing the
internals of React while avoiding huge breaking changes to developer's apps.
Really impressive! And now you know how to take advantage of `useDeferredValue`
for situations where you want to prioritize the rendering of some parts of your
app over others. Great work!
