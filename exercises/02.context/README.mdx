# Optimize Context

The way that context works is that whenever the provided value changes from one
render to another, it triggers a re-render of all the consuming components
(which will re-render whether or not they're memoized).

So take this for example:

```tsx
type CountContextValue = readonly [number, Dispatch<SetStateAction<number>>]
const CountContext = createContext<CountContextValue | null>(null)

function CountProvider(props) {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
	const value = [count, setCount]
	return <CountContext value={value} {...props} />
}
```

Every time the `<CountProvider />` is re-rendered, the `value` is brand new, so
even though the `count` value itself may stay the same, all component consumers
will be re-rendered.

This can be problematic in certain scenarios.

The quick and easy solution to this problem is to memoize the value that you
provide to the context provider:

```tsx lines=6
type CountContextValue = readonly [number, Dispatch<SetStateAction<number>>]
const CountContext = createContext<CountContextValue | null>(null)

function CountProvider(props) {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
	const value = useMemo(() => [count, setCount], [count])
	return <CountContext value={value} {...props} />
}
```

By memoizing the value, you're ensuring that the value is only re-created when
the `count` value changes. As a result, the consuming components will only
rerender when the `count` value changes.
