# Element Optimization

Elements are the fundamentals building blocks of React UI. It was the first
we started with when you started learning React in this workshop series. And
React has some smarts under the hood we can take advantage of when we're
rendering elements.

What we're going to be learning about in this exercise can be summed up as:

> If you give React the same element you gave it on the last render, it wont
> bother re-rendering that element. â€“ [@kentcdodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/1143200604065431552)

Here's a simple example:

```tsx
function Message({ greeting }) {
	console.log('rendering greeting', greeting)
	return <div>{greeting}</div>
}

function Counter() {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
	const increment = () => setCount((c) => c + 1)
	return (
		<div>
			<button onClick={increment}>The count is {count}</button>
			<Message greeting="Hello!" />
		</div>
	)
}
```

With this set up, we'll get a log every time the counter is incremented. Meaning
the `<Message />` component is rerendered every time its parent rerenders
(which is to be expected). But this is unnecessary since the greeting component
won't ever change what it's rendering.

What if I refactored things a little bit. For example:

```tsx
function Message({ greeting }) {
	console.log('rendering greeting', greeting)
	return <div>{greeting}</div>
}

const message = <Message greeting="Hello!" />

function Counter() {
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
	const increment = () => setCount((c) => c + 1)
	return (
		<div>
			<button onClick={increment}>The count is {count}</button>
			{message}
		</div>
	)
}
```

In this situation, the `<Message />` component only renders once and won't
rerender whenever the count changes. This is because we're giving React the same
element every time. How does this work?

When React is given the same element it was given on the last render, it won't
bother rerendering that element again because that would be pointless. It just
keeps the same element and moves on.

This is a simple, but powerful optimization that can help you avoid unnecessary
rerenders in your application. It's not always possible to do this, but you'd be
surprised how **simply restructuring your components** can make this possible
more and more often.

<callout-info class="aside">
	The composition pattern we learned in the Advanced React Patterns workshop
	also takes advantage of this optimization as well (that pattern sure does pop
	up a lot!).

The optimization we're going to be learning about in this exercise is explained
with examples in
