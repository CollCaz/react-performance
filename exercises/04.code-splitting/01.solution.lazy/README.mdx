👨‍💼 Great! That makes our initial page load **much** lighter than before. Based
on my count in the development environment, we've gone from 2.0 MB JavaScript
downloaded to 1.4 MB. That's a 30% reduction in the amount of JavaScript we're
sending to the client. That's a big win!

If you're curious, you could try running the production version of this app
(`npm run build` and `npm run preview` in the playground directory) and you'll
find we go from 376 KB to 189 KB. That's over a 50% reduction! Huge!

Of course, once you show the globe we have to load the rest of it, but there are
things you can do to optimize even that so the user's waiting less. Let's try
