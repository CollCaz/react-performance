# React Performance ‚ö°

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/react-performance/react-performance-outro-v2" />

üë®‚Äçüíº Congratulations! You've finished this workshop and you did an awesome job.
There's still so much more we can do to improve performance of our applications,
but you've now been given the tools to analyze and improve your own
applications.

<callout-danger class="important">
	Remember: measure first, then optimize, then measure again. Don't make your
	code more complex for no reason.
</callout-danger>

ü¶â One last thing I want to note is that everything we've done in this workshop
involved client-rendered applications. There's a ceiling of performance
improvements you hit with client-rendered applications. To break through that
ceiling, you need to start looking at server-rendered applications with
[Remix](https://remix.run).

That said, everything we've learned in this workshop applies in a Remix context.
So you're not only prepared to optimize React applications generally, this
knowledge will help you to optimize even a Remix application in many ways! Good
work!
