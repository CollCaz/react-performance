# Memoize Components

🦉 Memoizing elements is such a common idea that React has a built-in optimizer
called `memo` which allows you to memoize an entire component based on its
props:

```tsx
import { memo } from 'react'

const MyComponent = memo(function MyComponent(props) {
	/* only rerenders if props change */
})
```

This effectively turns the `props` object into a dependency array a la `useMemo`
and applys wherever the component is rendered.

🧝‍♂️ <PrevDiffLink>I've moved the `Footer` out of `useMemo`</PrevDiffLink> so
we've got it rendering unnecessarily again.

👨‍💼 You're going to use `memo` to get the `Footer` back into a position where
it only renders when the `name` or `color` change. Good luck!
